# final_project

## First Segment
* The topic we chose to analyze is how the rise in sea levels have been affected by factors such as temperature change, CO2 emissions, and population across the globe dating back to 1992. 

* The reason for selecting this topic is because it is relevant today, important for the future, and because we love our planet. Global warming is rising every year, and it's affecting the temperature and sea level across the world. With our research we want to predict if the sea level and temperature continues to rise every year, how our planet will look in the future. 

* We will be using linear regression algorithms in Machine Learning to be able to predict what levels the sea will rise to in the future. Linear regression is the most used algorithm in Machine Learning and a significant variable from the data set is chosen to predict the future values.

### Tools used to create this project
* Git and Github will be used to be able to work on this project as a team
* Excel will be used to examine data
* Python and jupyter note book will be use to write the code for the mechine learning model and to clean data.
* SQL will be used to store, retrieve, manage and manipulate data
* Tableau will be used to create data visualizations
* Google Slides will be used to present everything (link below)                                   https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C28iUiatFXmiYrv96hdG4Ypgk_fTbQ6fAfPpmc_o6hA/edit#slide=id.p

### Communication Protocols 
We have been communicating through Slack and arranged time outside of class to work on the project. 

### Machine Learning Model & Database Integration
Our machine learning model is located in sealevelprojection.ipynb and our datasets are loaded into the repository.
