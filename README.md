# final_project

## First Segment
* The topic we chose to analyze is how the rise in sea levels have been affected by temperature changes across the globe dating back to 1993. 

* The reason for selecting this topic is because it is relevant today, important for the future, and because we love our planet. 
The reason we chose this topic because global warming is rising every year, and it's affecting  the temperature and sea level  across the world wide. With our research we want to predict if the seal level and temperature continue to rise every year then how our planet will look in the future like next 20 years.

* The data we are pulling comes from kaggle.com. 

* We will be using linear regression algorithms in Machine Learning to be able to predict what levels the sea will rise to in the future. Linear regression is most used algorithms in Machine learning and a significant variable from the data set is chosen to predict the future values.  

### Communication Protocols 
We have been communicating through Slack and arranged time outside of class to work on the project. 

### Machine Learning Model & Database Integration
Our machine learning model is located in linear regression.ipynb and our datasets are loaded into the repository.
