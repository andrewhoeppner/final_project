# final_project

## First Segment
* The topic we chose to analyze is how the rise in sea levels have been affected by temperature changes across the globe dating back to 1993. 

* The reason for selecting this topic is because it is relevant today, important for the future, and because we love our planet. 

* The data we are pulling comes from XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX and shows us XXXXXXXXXXXXXX. 

* We will use machine learning to be able to predict what levels the sea will rise to in the future. 

### Communication Protocols 
We have been communicating through Slack and arranged time outside of class to work on the project. 

### Machine Learning Model & Database Integration
Our machine learning model is located in linear regression.ipynb and our datasets are loaded into the repository.
